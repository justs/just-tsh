### Design Philosophy

A design concept and theme is developed based upon a market research analysis, facilities program, client vision, and project location.  Each spa is unique to its surroundings and based on Trilogyâ€™s philosophy for healthy living.  Design the spa to convey an atmosphere of; quality, personalized attention, rejuvenation, escape and comfort in a luxurious environment. No two projects are alike.
